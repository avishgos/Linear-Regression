# Linear-Regression

Linear regression is perhaps one of the most well known and well understood algorithms in statistics and machine learning.
Linear regression is an attractive model because the representation is so simple.
The representation is a linear equation that combines a specific set of input values (x) the solution to which is the predicted output for that set of input values (y).
As such, both the input values (x) and the output value are numeric.

In this repository, you can see many files related to Linear Regression. These contains various methods of using Linear Regression on various datasets so you can clearly understand,how your algorithm is working. All these datasets are enough for you to understand the working of Linear Regression.
